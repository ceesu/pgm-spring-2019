### 3.1.1  Exploiting independence Properties
#### Standard vs compact parametrization of  independent random variables
Given random variables $$X_i$$ each representing the outcome of an independent coin toss, the standard parametrization of their joint distribution would be as follows:

$$ P(X_1, ... X_n) = P(X_1 = x_1, X_2=x_2, ..., X_n = x_n) = P(X_1 = x_1)P(X_2=x_2)...P(X_n=x_n) $$

Note there are 2 possibilities for each outcome $$x_i$$, this representation requires $$2^n$$ parameters. However, only $$2^n -1$$ will be independent parameters since the last probability is fully determined by the first $$2^n$$ (all probabilities sum to 1).

One simple way to reduce the number of parameters needed, would be to represent the probability that each coin toss lands heads as $$ \theta_1, ... \theta_n $$.  Then we have the following compact representation requiring only $$n$$ parameters:

$$ P(X_1, ... X_n) = \prod_i \theta_{X_i} $$

### 3.1.3 Naive Bayes
We can further express the joint distribution in terms of conditional probabilities. This is done in the Naive Bayes model.

 Instances of this model will include:
* class : some category $$ C \in \{c^1, ...c^k\} $$ which gives a prior on the value of each feature
* features: observed properties $$X_1, ... X_k$$ 

The model makes the strong  'naive' conditional independence assumption:

$$ P(x_i | C,  x_1, \dots, x_n) = P(x_i | C) $$

In words, _features are conditionally independent, given the class of the instance of this model_.  Thus the joint distribution of the Naive Bayes model factorizes as follows:

$$ P(C, X_1, ... X_n) = P(C) \prod_i P(X_i |C) $$

### 3.2.1 Bayesian networks
Bayesian networks use a graph whose nodes are the random variables in the domain, and whose edges represent conditional probability  statements. Unlike in the Naive Bayes model, Bayesian networks can also represent distributions that do not satisfy the naive conditional independence assumption. 
#### Definition 3.1: Bayesian Network (BN)
A bayesian network $$\mathcal{G}$$ is a directed acyclic graph, whose nodes represent random variables $$X_1, ...X_n $$. Let $$Pa_{X_i}^{\mathcal{G}}$$ denote the parents of $$X_i \in \mathcal{G}$$ and $$NonDescendants_{X_i}$$ denote the variables in the graph which are not descendants of $$X_i$$. Then $$\mathcal{G}$$ encodes the following set of conditional independence assumptions, also called the 'local independencies' and denoted by $$I_l(\mathcal{G})$$:

For each variable $$ X_i: (X_i \perp NonDescendants_{X_i} | Pa_{X_i}^{\mathcal{G}} ) $$
### 3.2.3 Graphs and Distributions

In this section it is shown that the distribution $$P$$ satisfies the local independencies associated with  $$\mathcal{G} \iff P$$ is representable as a set of conditional probability distributions (CPDs) associated with $$\mathcal{G}$$. 

#### Definition 3.2-3.3: I-Map
Let $$P$$ be a distribution over $$\mathcal{X}$$. We define $$I(P)$$ to be the set of independence assertions of the form $$ X \perp Y | Z $$ that hold in $$P$$.

Let $$\mathcal{K}$$ be any graph object associated with a set of independencies $$I(\mathcal{K})$$. We say $$\mathcal{K}$$ is an I-map for $$I$$ if $$I(\mathcal{K}) \subseteq I$$

**Note this means that $$\mathcal{G}$$ is an I-map for $$P $$ if $$\mathcal{G}$$ is an I-map for $$I(P)$$.**

#### I-Map to factorization

In this section  it is proven (see text) that the conditional independence assumptions implied by the BN structure $$\mathcal{G}$$ allow us to factorize the distribution $$P$$ for which $$\mathcal{G}$$ is an I-map into conditional probability distributions. 

##### Definition 3.4 Factorization
Let $$P$$ be a distribution and $$\mathcal{G}$$ be a BN graph over random variables $$X_1, ...X_n $$. We say that $$P$$ _factorizes_ according to $$\mathcal{G}$$ if $$P$$ can be expressed as a product:

$$ P(X_1, ... X_n) = \prod_i P( X_i | Pa_{X_i}^{\mathcal{G}}) $$

##### Reduction in number of parameters
In a distribution over $$n$$ binary variables, specifying the joint distribution will require $$2^n - 1$$ independent parameters (as stated in 3.1.1). However if the distribution factorizes according to  $$\mathcal{G}$$ where each node has at most $$k$$ parents, then the number of independent parameters is $$ < 2^k$$. 

**Since $$k$$ is usually small, this represents an exponential reduction in number of parameters.**

#### Factorization to I-map
The converse also holds as given by the following theorem:
##### Theorem 3.2
Let  $$\mathcal{G}$$ be a BN graph over random variables $$X $$ and $$P$$ be a distribution over the same space. If $$P$$ factorizes according to $$\mathcal{G}$$ then $$\mathcal{G}$$ is an I-map for  $$P$$.

### Box 3.C Knowledge engineering

 Building a BN in the real world requires many steps including:

* _picking variables precisely_: we need some variables that can be observed, and their domain should be specified. Sometimes introducing hidden variables will help to render the observed variables conditionally independent.
* _picking a structure consistent with the causal order_: choose enough variables to approximate the causal relationships. 
* _picking probability estimates for events in the network_: data collection may be difficult but small errors have little effect (though the network is sensitive to events assigned a zero probability, and to relative size of probabilities of events)

Done correctly, the model will be useful as well as not too complex to use (see Box 3.D).

### 3.3.1 D-separation

Objective: determine which independencies hold for every distribution $$P$$ which factorizes over $$G$$.

By examining 2-edge connections between nodes $$X,Y,Z$$ four types of active trails, i.e. trails along which influence can flow from $$X$$ to $$Z$$, are apparent:

1. Causal trail
2. Evidential trail
3. Common cause
4. Common effect

For influence to flow through a longer trail $$ X_1 \rightleftharpoons ... \rightleftharpoons X_n  $$, every two-edge trail within must allow influence flow. This is summarized as follows:

#### Definition 3.6 active trail
Let $$\mathcal{G}$$ be a BN structure and. $$ X_1 \rightleftharpoons  ... \rightleftharpoons X_n  $$ be a trail in $$\mathcal{G}$$. Let $$Z$$ be a subset of observed variables. Then the trail $$ X_1 \rightleftharpoons  ... \rightleftharpoons  X_n$$ is active given $$Z  $$ if:

* Whenever we have a v-structure $$ X_{I-1}  \to X_i \leftarrow X_{I+1}  $$ then $$X_i$$ or one of its descendants are in $$Z$$
* No other node along the trail is in $$Z$$

Further, for directed graphs that may have more than one trail between nodes "directed separation" (d-separation) gives a notion of separation between nodes.

#### Definition 3.7 D-separation 
Let $$X,Y,Z$$ be three sets of nodes in $$\mathcal{G}$$. We say that *$$X, Y$$* are d-separated given $$Z$$ (denoted $$\text{d-sep}_{\mathcal{G}} (X; Y | Z)$$ ) if there is no active trail between any node X $$\in X$$ and Y$$\in Y$$ given $$Z$$. 

### 3.3.2 Soundness and Completeness
As a method d-separation has the following properties (proof in text):

_Soundness_: $$ X, Y $$ are d-separated given $$ Z $$ implies $$ X \perp Y | Z $$ i.e. independence determined by d-separation is satisfied by the underlying distribution. 

_Completeness_:  If $$ X \perp Y | Z $$ then they are d-separated, i.e. d-separation detects all possible independencies.

# In class notes

Motivation: representing joint distributions over some random variables is computationally expensive, so we need methodologies to represent joint distributions compactly.

## Notation

* Variable: capitalized english letter, with subscripts to represent dimensions (i, j, k) and superscripts to represent index e.g. $$V_{i, j}^j$$ 
* Values of variables: a lowercase letter means it is an 'observed value' of some random variable e.g. $$v_{i, j}^j$$
* Random variable: a variable with stochasticity, changing across different observations
* Random vector: capitalized and bold letter, with random vars as entries (of dimension 1xn)
* Random matrix: capitalized and bold letter, with random vars as entries (of dimension nxm)
* Parameters: greek characters. Can be considered random variables


## Two types of Graphical Models <d-cite key="Blei:2015:BasicsPGM"></d-cite><d-cite key="Jordan:2003:PGM"></d-cite>
### Directed Graphs (Bayesian Networks)
An acyclic graph, $$\mathcal{G}$$, is made up of a set of nodes, $$\mathcal{V}$$, and a set 
of directed edges, $$\mathcal{E}$$, where edges represent a causality relationship between nodes. Nodes in the graph represent a set of random variables, $$\{x_1,...,x_N\}$$, where there is a one-to-one map between nodes and random variables.

We define  $$x_{\pi_i}$$ and $$x_{\iota_i}$$ as the set of parent nodes and non-ancestor nodes 
for the $$i$$ node, respectively. The topology of a directed graph asserts the set of conditional independence statements:

$$ \{ x_i \, \bot \, x_{\iota_i} \, | \, x_{\pi_i} \} $$

As a result, the joint probability of the above directed graph can be written as follows:

$$p(\{x_1,..,x_6 \}) = \prod\limits_{i =1}^N p(x_i \, | \, x_{\pi_i})$$

$$p(\{x_1,..,x_6 \}) = p(x_1)p(x_2|x_1)p(x_3|x_1)p(x_4|x_2)p(x_5|x_3)p(x_6|x_2,x_5)$$

A directed graph provides the skeleton for representing a joint distribution compactly in a factorized way. 


### Undirected Graphs (Markov Random Fields) <d-cite key="Jordan:2003:PGM"></d-cite>
An undirected graph contains nodes that are connected via non-directional edges.

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/notes/lecture-02/undirected-graph.png' | relative_url }}" height ="270" width = "480" />

The joint probability of the above undirected graph can be written as followed:

$$p(\textbf{x}) = \frac{1}{Z}exp\bigg(E(x_1)+ E(x_2,x_1)+E(x_3,x_1)+E(x_4,x_2) + E(x_5,x_2,x_6)\bigg)$$
